Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) is an integrated environment provided by Microsoft for managing and developing SQL Server databases. SSMS offers tools that facilitate database management, query execution, reporting, and analysis. Its user-friendly interface allows database administrators and developers to manage and analyze their databases more efficiently.


During my internship and school projects, I designed and managed the databases I created using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS). Through this process, I gained experience in structuring databases, ensuring data integration, and performing data analysis with SQL queries.
